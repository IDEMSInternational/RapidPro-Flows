The mean is one way of describing a whole set of data with just one number. The median is another way describing the set of data with one number. If the puzzle had asked "The median of 16 different positive integers is 16. What is the greatest possible value that any of these integers could have?", then there would be no solution as you could choose any number as large as you like for the biggest number, as the value of the median of 16 numbers depends only on the eight and ninth biggest numbers!

A version of this problem was originally solved by Leonard Euler. In a city consisting of 4 islands linked by bridges, he wondered if it is possible to go for a walk and cross each bridge exactly once. If you draw a vertex for each island, and a line between two vertices for each bridge, you get a drawing like in this puzzle.

The probability of any 2 people having different birthdays is roughly 364 ∕ 365 there are 253 different pairs of people in a room of 23 people so the probability of them all having different birthdays is roughly 364 ∕ 365 to the power 253. This is 0.4995 slightly less than 50% so the probability of having 2 people in the room with the same birthday is just over 50%. Actually we should be including leap years but the result is still true if you do.

The proof of the four colour theorem was famously tricky, and comes from graph theory, where mathematicians investigate an equivalent problem of colouring vertices of a network so that no edge has endpoints the same colour. The original four-colour proof was attempted by Alfred Kempe in 1879, but unfortunately Percy John Heawood found an error 11 years later. However his work was not useless, as Percy was able to prove the five-colour theorem (that one can colour a map with no two adjacent regions the sample colour using at most 5 colours) based on Kempe's work. The four colour theorem was finally proved in 1976 by Kenneth Appel, Wolfgang Haken, and John Koch using a computer to check it. This was the first major theorem to be proved using a computer. They checked around 1500 configurations using about 1200 hours of computer time. Some people were sceptical about a proof using a computer but independent verification soon convinced everyone that the four colour theorem had finally been proved.

Bernard Frénicle de Bessy wrote about the number 1729 in 1657, but it was made popular by G. H. Hardy telling a story about Srinivasa Ramanujan in about 1919: "I remember once going to see him when he was ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. "No," he replied, "it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways." 1729 is now called a "taxicab" number. It is the second taxi cab number. The first is 2 because it is the smallest number that can be written in one way as the sum of two cubes. 87539319 is the third taxi cab number because it is the smallest number that can be written in three different ways as the sum of two cubes. No one knows what the taxicab numbers are above the 6th one.

The distance between the Earth and the Moon is a bit less than 400000 kilometers (or 250000 miles). For us the paper is 0.1 millimeter (mm) thick. If we fold the paper once, its thickness would be doubled, so it becomes 0.2mm. Folding it again gives 0.4mm. If we fold it 10 times, it becomes (0.1mm)×2¹⁰ (two to the power 10). Now, if we compute (0.1mm)×2⁴², the result is 440 000km!

A right-truncatable prime is a prime number that remains a prime when you successively remove the last digit. We can look for the biggest right-truncatable prime by starting with the one digit primes 2, 3, 5, and 7. Then try to add another digit to the right of these so that the new numbers are also prime. We could have 23, 29, 31, 37, 53, 59, 71, 73, and 79. Now we try to add another digit. We could have 233, 239, 293, 311, 313, 317, 373, 379, 593, 599, 719, 733, 739, and 797. If we keep going with this process we end up with these eight digit numbers 23399339, 29399999, 37337999, 59393339, and 73939133. There are no nine digit prime numbers that start with any of these eight digits so the biggest right-truncatable number is 73939133.

We want to work out how many different combinations of 52 cards there are. Let us start with thinking about just 3 cards. We could compare this to thinking about the number of ways 3 people could sit in three numbered chairs. Any of the three people could sit on the first chair, then either of the 2 remaining people could sit on the second chair and then there is 1 person left who would have no choice but to sit on the only remaining chair. We can multiply the number of choices for each chair (3×2×1 = 6) to find how many different ways there are for the 3 people to be arranged. It is interesting to note that the pattern here is taking the initial number then multiplying consecutively by the next smallest integer until you reach 1. This process has a name, it is called Factorial. The symbol for it is !. e.g. 3! = 6. Generally if you want to find the number of different ways you can rearrange n items, you can find n! = n!×(n - 1)!×(n - 2)!×…×1 The number of ways to shuffle 52 cards is 52! = 52×51×50×…×3×2×1 which is roughly equal to  8×10⁶⁷

Because of the spacing of the horizontal lines we see that we are most likely to get a value of y with first digit 1, then we are next likely to get a value of y with a first digit 2, etc. These probabilities are what leads to Benford's Law.

Pick a positive integer (whole number), e.g. 57. Reverse the digits to get 75. Adding gives 57 +75 = 132. Then reverse this new number and add together. You get 132 + 231 = 353. This is a palindrome as it reads the same forwards as backwards, so we stop. Can you find a number that takes longer to reach a palindrome?

Please select the number for the following options:
1. I still don’t get it. Show me.
2. I get it! That’s cool, tell me more.
3. Give me something else to do.

If you change the base of the problem to binary then 10110 (22 in decimal) is a Lychrel number. The name Lychrel comes from a rough anagram of Wade Van Landingham's girlfriend Cheryl.

A number is called a Lychrel number if it never reaches a palindrome. No one has proved that a Lychrel number exists. One possibility is 196 - the first billion steps have been carried out by computers and it hasn't reached a palindrome… but this does not prove it never will!

Think of a positive integer (whole number). If it is even, halve it. It if is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat the process with your new number and keep going. Stop if you get to the number 1. Nobody knows if a number exists that doesn't end up at 1.

For example, if you choose the number 6 you would get this sequence 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. So it took 8 steps to get to 1. Try some numbers of your own.

The conjecture is named after Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937, two years after receiving his doctorate. Many people since Collatz have tried to find a sequence that doesn't go to 1, or to prove that all sequences go to 1 and no one has succeeded. There is a prize of at least $2,000 dollars if you succeed! On the 8th of September 2019, Terence Tao produced a proof, using sampling of numbers, that almost all numbers eventually reach a value that is quite close to 1. Roughly speaking he proved that 99% of starting values greater than 1 quadrillion eventually reach a value below 200. This is a huge step forward for such a difficult problem!

This activity is interesting because it is easy to understand the rules and start generating sequences, but no one knows whether all numbers end up at 1; it is an unsolved problem in mathematics. The longest sequence for a number smaller than 100 is for 97, which takes 118 steps but finally gets to 1. The number just before, 96, only takes 12 steps! Using computers, all numbers up to roughly 2.95×10²⁰ have been checked and they all go to 1.

21 is a simple version of the set of games, Nim. It is sometimes called a Misère game - meaning a game that you play to lose. It is thought to have originated in China and is first mentioned in European history at the start of the 16ᵗʰ century. The game was originally played with 21 stones, and you have to pick 1, 2, or 3 stones at a time and the loser is the last one to pick a stone.

This puzzle is an example of a Latin square. Interestingly, if the problem had involved 6 ranks of playing cards it would have been impossible. But with 7 ranks it is quite easy to find a solution.

It is very important to be watching your opponents moves as well as trying to make a line of 5 yourself. If your opponent has three in a row with nothing at either end - this is called "open 3" - then it is a good idea to use your turn to block one end. If they manage to get "open 4" you have certainly lost! A good attacking strategy might be to aim for two overlapping lines of open 3s - like a cross - so that it is very hard for your opponent to defend.

So people write an artificial intelligence program and their program plays against someone else's program to see who wins. There are also computer vs. human competitions - in 2017 a computer called Yixin beat the world champion human player Rudolf Dupszki 2-0.

The number 24 is used because it has so many factors. However, an analysis of all the possible combinations of 4 cards shows that the number 2 would have been the best target number! 99.19% of the combinations could be solved, compared to 80.20% for 24. If you are allowed to use factorials (e.g. 3! = 3×2×1 = 6), then you can solve many more combinations for 24.

Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting. Two big aspects of combinatorics are finding combinations and permutations. For combinations the order does not matter - like in our football example we didn't mind which order the away team scored the goals. For permutations the order does matter - for example there are six ways to arrange the digits 123.

This is a classic puzzle that has been around for many years. There are many problem-solving strategies that can be used to find the solution - act it out, draw a diagram, look for a pattern, solve a simpler problem, make an organized list, make a table, use logical reasoning, . . . . The solution has deep mathematical properties and is a key result in the field of combinatorics. The number of handshakes is always a triangular number. The first ten triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, …
