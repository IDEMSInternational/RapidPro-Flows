  "You can play this game like Snap, with 2 or 4 players. Deal the cards (without the 10, J, Q, K, or Jokers) equally to all players. For two players, on the count of three, they each turn over the top two cards from their pile. For four players, they each just turn over one card. Everyone tries to make 24 using all four cards. The first person to do so takes the cards and puts them at the bottom of their pile. Play continues until one player has run out of cards - then the player with the most cards is the winner.": "You can play this game like Snap, with 2 or 4 players.

  "The number 24 is used because it has so many factors. However, an analysis of all the possible combinations of 4 cards shows that the number 2 would have been the best target number! 99.19% of the combinations could be solved, compared to 80.20% for 24. If you are allowed to use factorials (e.g. 3! = 3\u00d72\u00d71 = 6), then you can solve many more combinations for 24.": "The number 24 is used because it has so many factors.
