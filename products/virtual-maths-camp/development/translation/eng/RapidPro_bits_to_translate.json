  "The proof of the four colour theorem was famously tricky, and comes from graph theory, where mathematicians investigate an equivalent problem of colouring vertices of a network so that no edge has endpoints the same colour. The original four-colour proof was attempted by Alfred Kempe in 1879, but unfortunately Percy John Heawood found an error 11 years later. However his work was not useless, as Percy was able to prove the five-colour theorem (that one can colour a map with no two adjacent regions the sample colour using at most 5 colours) based on Kempe's work. The four colour theorem was finally proved in 1976 by Kenneth Appel, Wolfgang Haken, and John Koch using a computer to check it. This was the first major theorem to be proved using a computer. They checked around 1500 configurations using about 1200 hours of computer time. Some people were sceptical about a proof using a computer but independent verification soon convinced everyone that the four colour theorem had finally been proved.": "The proof of the four colour theorem was famously tricky, and comes from graph theory, where mathematicians investigate an equivalent problem of colouring vertices of a network so that no edge has endpoints the same colour.

  "We want to work out how many different combinations of 52 cards there are. Let us start with thinking about just 3 cards. We could compare this to thinking about the number of ways 3 people could sit in three numbered chairs. Any of the three people could sit on the first chair, then either of the 2 remaining people could sit on the second chair and then there is 1 person left who would have no choice but to sit on the only remaining chair. We can multiply the number of choices for each chair (3×2×1 = 6) to find how many different ways there are for the 3 people to be arranged. It is interesting to note that the pattern here is taking the initial number then multiplying consecutively by the next smallest integer until you reach 1. This process has a name, it is called Factorial. The symbol for it is !. e.g. 3! = 6. Generally if you want to find the number of different ways you can rearrange n items, you can find n! = n!×(n - 1)!×(n - 2)!×…×1 The number of ways to shuffle 52 cards is 52! = 52×51×50×…×3×2×1 which is roughly equal to  8×10⁶⁷": "We want to work out how many different combinations of 52 cards there are.
