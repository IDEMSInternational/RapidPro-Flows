Many people since Collatz have tried to find a sequence that doesn't go to 1, or to prove that all sequences go to 1 and no one has succeeded. There is a prize of at least $2,000 dollars if you succeed! On the 8th of September 2019, Terence Tao produced a proof, using sampling of numbers, that almost all numbers eventually reach a value that is quite close to 1. Roughly speaking he proved that 99% of starting values greater than 1 quadrillion eventually reach a value below 200. This is a huge step forward for such a difficult problem!",

Hardy telling a story about Srinivasa Ramanujan in about 1919: \"I remember once going to see him when he was ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. \"No,\" he replied, \"it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.\" 1729 is now called a \"taxicab\" number. It is the second taxi cab number. The first is 2 because it is the smallest number that can be written in one way as the sum of two cubes. 87539319 is the third taxi cab number because it is the smallest number that can be written in three different ways as the sum of two cubes. No one knows what the taxicab numbers are above the 6th one.",

    "source_text": "Bernard Frénicle de Bessy wrote about the number 1729 in 1657, but it was made popular by G. H. Hardy telling a story about Srinivasa Ramanujan in about 1919: \"I remember once going to see him when he was ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. \"No,\" he replied, \"it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.\" 1729 is now called a \"taxicab\" number. It is the second taxi cab number. The first is 2 because it is the smallest number that can be written in one way as the sum of two cubes. 87539319 is the third taxi cab number because it is the smallest number that can be written in three different ways as the sum of two cubes. No one knows what the taxicab numbers are above the 6th one."
