          "Message 1": "4. Talking about difficult emotions\n\nIt is normal to have difficulty talking about and expressing emotions and feelings. Many of us were told not to cry when we were sad or laugh when we were happy. This may be especially the case for boys and men.",
          "Message 2": "But we all have the same feelings, and  we can learn how to become aware of our own emotions, to experience them in our body, and to communicate about them."

          "Message": "5. Notice the positive emotions\n\nTalking about feelings can help children manage anger, disappointment, and frustration.

        "Option 6: Show your child that you care": {
          "Message": "6. Show your child that you care\n\nUse physical and verbal support to make your child feel accepted and loved. A hug or saying, \"I understand,\" can mean a lot. Remind your child that you are there for them and that they can always talk to you. "
